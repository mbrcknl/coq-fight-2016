# Coq Fight 2016

The `submissions` directory contains the lemmas I submitted to the 2016 FP-Syd
Coq Fight, with answers in the `solutions` branch.

## Retrospective

Not all of these lemmas were used in the competition. Of the ones that were
used, almost all turned out to be too hard, mainly because there were too many
lemmas in each set. Partly, this had been intentional, because I had thought it
might be interesting to award a round to the contestant that got furthest within
a time limit. However, having now seen the competition, I fully agree with
[Amos][], that it's more important to achieve a sense of closure in as many
rounds as possible.

I also vastly underestimated how difficult it is in the competition setting, to
comprehend anything but the simplest of definitions!
